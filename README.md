## Appendix

This project involved meticulous manual entry of Guy's cryptocurrency portfolio asset allocation from publicly available newsletters, sourced either from his website or directly received as newsletters. Gathering and organizing this data within a spreadsheet demanded considerable time and effort. The data was methodically cleaned and structured to suit the tool's requirements.

Utilizing an online visualization tool, Flourish Studio, I translated this structured data into a dynamic running donut chart. The process involved uploading the prepared data and customizing various elements. To accurately represent each cryptocurrency, I acquired hex codes from ChatGPT, ensuring distinct and coherent colors for visualization. Additionally, I optimized the legend's order and made several refinements to enhance the visual appeal of the chart.

Throughout the creation process, troubleshooting was essential to achieve the desired output. Experimenting with different settings within Flourish Studio was crucial for refining the visualization. Furthermore, I conducted research to gather Guy's information, which helped in addressing potential FAQs related to the project.

However, it's important to note that future tracking of Guy's portfolio has shifted exclusively to the Coin Bureau Club (CBC) for subscribed members. The CBC platform now hosts Guy's portfolio information, along with that of other core Coin Bureau team members. Features include a watchlist of cryptocurrencies under consideration, access to Coin Bureau's altcoin review videos, and an exclusive research feed where Guy and the team share insights and alpha. Members enjoy numerous benefits, including unlimited access to CBC's growing archive and the opportunity to vote on upcoming project coverage.
